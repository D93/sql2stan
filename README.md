Integrating Bayesian inference with Stan into PostgreSQL database management.

That means: you can write a probabilistic program in SQL using your relational database schema. 

Basically, you can start off with only a Bayesian network of your interest (basically, a probabilistic model), and then work your way through until you've got a DBMS-with-Bayesian-inference approach set up and running. You'll find the description of this process in the PDF with my master thesis. 
But ACHTUNG, it's written in german.
